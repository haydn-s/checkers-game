# checkers-game
## About
This is an interactive checkers game to practice using a new technology stack. The backend processes and stores checkers games while the frontend provides a window for the user to view the board state and play moves.

The goal of this project is to practice fullstack engineering design and become familiar with new technologies.

## Technology Stack
  1) Go (backend)
  2) React (frontend)
  3) PostgresQL (database)
